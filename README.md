✨ A fictional event organizer's admin interface for managing all entities

> The goal of the project is to make an event organizer website where the user can see and search for various events being planned. All backend functionality is managed on a Java Spring backend project, serving the frontend with data via Rest API endpoints.
> The first sprint (this sprint) focused around the admin side of the website to showcase the various persistence operations being used in conjunction with Hibernate. React is used to present the changes realtime on the frontend.
